# STReputation

### What is it?
STReputation is a simple reputation system for Garry's Mod DarkRP.  Created because someone requested it, I uploaded it to my workshop, where is was pretty ignored, and the thumbnail was bad, so I just removed it.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the STReputation folder into your addons folder.  Configure it however you want and enjoy!

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, and upload it to the workshop if you really want to, but please just make it look good.  Don't leave the description as "Description" and don't select a random image from your desktop.
